Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String. Then you must read 3 lines of input from stdin and initialize your 3 variables. Finally, you must use the + operator to perform the following operations:

Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
